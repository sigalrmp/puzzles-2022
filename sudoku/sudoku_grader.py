# so how do I systematically do this?
# here are the first two things that I want to make it infer:
#   1. if there are n places in a section that have the same n options AND NO OTHERS then
#       - no other spaces in that section can have those options
#   2. if there are n options in a section that ONLY appear in the same n spaces then
#       - those spaces cannot have any other options
# strategies:
#   1. for each space in each section, count (starting at one so that the space is counted) how
#      many spaces in their section (that have not already been checked) have the same list 
#      of options as them (using ==), and if that count is equal to the length of the list,
#      remove all options in that list from all other spaces in that section
#   2. for each possible option i in each section, make a list of the spaces that they are an
#      option for. Then, for each i, count (starting at one so that the option is
#      counted) how many other options (that haven't been checked yet) have the same list of
#      spaces. If that count is equal to the length of the list, the spaces in that list cannot
#      have any options aside from those possible options

#  finished:
#   - can do the two basic inferences
# to do:
#   - make it so once it's gotten as far as it can get like that, it goes through
#     all the situations where there are only n options (where n is different depending on the
#     difficulty) and in each of those situations, infers things up to m times (so not that deep)
#     compare the boards and if there is anything that all of the possible boards agree on, add
#     to the notes. Then start making inferences again. Continue doing this, and if it never works
#     the puzzle is too hard.
