# puzzles-2022

This is the code for the first two puzzles that I have finished: Sudoku and futoshiki.

SUDOKU

Run the file in the sudoku folder called gen_sudoku_board.py to test generating sudoku boards.

FUTOSHIKI

Run the file in the futoshiki folder called gen_futoshiki_board.py to test generating futoshiki boards.

HASHI

Run the file in the hashi folder called gen_hashi_board.py to test generating hashi boards. This will take awhile, especially for the harder boards, and since I've had much less time for tuning constants, there are fewer features and fewer options for customization than the other games.

NOTE

I haven't yet gone over my code and edited, so it's not especially pretty. Furthermore, I only learned about python doctests after I had written the sudoku code, so that's there for futoshiki, but only print tests are used for sudoku and hashi.
