# puzzles-2022

This is the code for three puzzles: Sudoku, futoshiki and hashi.

## sudoku

Run the file in the sudoku folder called *gen_sudoku_board.py* to test generating sudoku boards.

## futoshiki

Run the file in the futoshiki folder called *gen_futoshiki_board.py* to test generating futoshiki boards.

## hashi

Run the file in the hashi folder called *gen_hashi_board.py* to test generating hashi boards. This will take awhile, especially for the harder boards, and since I've had much less time for tuning constants, there are fewer features and fewer options for customization than the other games.

## a note

I haven't yet gone over my code and edited, so it's not especially pretty. Furthermore, I only learned about python doctests after I had written the sudoku code, so they're used for futoshiki and hashi, but only print tests are used for sudoku.
