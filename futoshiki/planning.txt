Things to do:

Generator idea:
    - make a random board of numbers (of the given size)
    - between every two cells indicate which is bigger
    - recursively remove numbers and inequality indicators until it's not solvable, and then go back one step

Solver (not humanoid) idea: (DONE)
    - recursive backtracing
        - for each space generate all possible numbers
        - recursive try numbers in spaces until it's no longer a possible board, and then backtrack

Solver (humanoid) planning:
    - inferences
        - same as sudoku? let's check
