# puzzles-2022

This is the code for the first two puzzles that I have finished: Sudoku and futoshiki.

SUDOKU

Run the file in the sudoku folder called gen_sudoku_board.py to test generating sudoku boards.

FUTOSHIKI

Run the file in the futoshiki folder called gen_futoshiki_board.py to test generating futoshiki boards.

NOTE

I haven't yet gone over my code and edited, so it's not especially pretty. Furthermore, I only learned about python doctests after I had written the sudoku code, so that's there for futoshiki, but only print tests are used for sudoku.
