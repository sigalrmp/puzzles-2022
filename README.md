# puzzles-2022

This is the code for the first two puzzles that I wrote. I haven't yet gone over my previous code and edited, so it's not especially pretty. I also learned about python doctests after I had written the sudoku code, so that's there for futoshiki, but print tests are used for sudoku.


SUDOKU

Run the file called gen_sudoku_board.py to test generating sudoku boards.
